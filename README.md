![2023-06-27-01-52-45](https://github.com/JavierGF1991/drag-and-drop-jetpack-compose/assets/49919880/82468d2c-a778-4f21-99b9-234974e1d5da)

This project is a library that provides an extension of the Modifier class in Jetpack Compose, allowing you to easily add drag and drop behavior to list items in your applications. With this library, you can enhance the user experience by enabling users to drag items from a list and place them in a new position.

### üìÅ  Example Repo
https://github.com/JGomez-Dev/drag-and-drop-jetpack-compose

### :control_knobs: How to Use ###

To be able to use it, we will need to include the following in the Gradle file of our module where we want to use it:

```kotlin
implementation ("com.github.JGomez-Dev:drag-and-drop-compose-library:<version>")
```

In the settings.gradle:
```kotlin
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url = uri("https://jitpack.io") }
    }
}

dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url = uri("https://jitpack.io") }
    }
}
```

## :sparkles: Features
- Drag and drop items within a list.
- Smooth animation and visual effects during drag and drop.
- Reorder items in the list based on user interactions.

## :tada: Usage
To use this drag and drop example in your project, follow these steps:

1. Add the People data class to your project. The People class represents an item in the list and contains a name property.
2. Copy the BasicExample and HomeExample composable functions to your project.
3. Modify the code as needed to fit your project requirements.
4. Use the ExampleList composable function to display the list of items with drag and drop functionality. Pass the necessary parameters, such as the list of people, slide states, and update functions.
5. Make sure you have the necessary dependencies and setup for Compose and Material Design in your project.

## :computer: Code

Example
Here's an example usage of the drag and drop functionality:
```kotlin

val peopleList = mutableListOf(
    People(name = "Martin Jenkins"),
    People(name = "Jacquelyn Keith"),
    People(name = "Lavern Chen")
)

@Composable
fun App() {
    HomeExample()
}

@ExperimentalAnimationApi
@Composable
fun HomeExample() {
    Scaffold(
        topBar = {
            TopAppBar(
                title = {
                    Text(text = "Drag and Drop In Compose")
                }
            )
        }
    ) { innerPadding ->
        ExampleList(
            modifier = Modifier.padding(innerPadding),
            peopleList = peopleList,
            slideStates = slideStates,
            updateSlideState = { people, slideState ->
                // Handle slide state updates here
            },
            updateItemPosition = { currentIndex, destinationIndex ->
                // Handle item position updates here
            }
        )
    }
}

@ExperimentalAnimationApi
@Composable
fun ExampleList(
    modifier: Modifier,
    peopleList: MutableList<People>,
    slideStates: Map<People, SlideState>,
    updateSlideState: (people: People, slideState: SlideState) -> Unit,
    updateItemPosition: (currentIndex: Int, destinationIndex: Int) -> Unit
) {
    // ...
}
```
